# Week-6-api-Weather-app
weather app
User will input a city to see current weather and a 5 day forecast
Once the user clicks the search button a button corresponding to the city entered will appear
I tried to get the new buttons to populate the city object in local storage but was not able to do that successfully
Html, css, bootstrap, ajax, json, jquery, and javascript were used to creat this app
